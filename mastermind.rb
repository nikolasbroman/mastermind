Build these features:

- human player can choose between codemaker / codebreaker

- computer player as Code Maker
--- no need for AI, random is enough

- computer player as Code Breaker
--- easy: guess randomly, keep only fully correct
--- normal: guess randomly, keep fully correct, include half correct
--- hard/impossible: no need
